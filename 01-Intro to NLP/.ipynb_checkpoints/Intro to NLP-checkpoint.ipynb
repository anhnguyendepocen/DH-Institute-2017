    "# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, <i>Computational Text Analysis</i> is a set of interpretive methods which seek to understand patterns in human discourse, in part through statistics. More familiar methods, such as close reading, are exceptionally well-suited to the analysis of individual texts, however our research questions typically compel us to look for relationships across texts, sometimes counting in the thousands or even millions. We have to zoom out, in order to perform so-called <i>distant reading</i>. Fortunately for us, computers are well-suited to identify the kinds of textual relationships that exist at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will spend the week exploring research questions that computational methods can help to answer and thinking about how these complement -- rather than displace -- other interpretive methods. Before moving to that conceptual level, however, we will familiarize ourselves with the basic tools of the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Natural Language Processing</i> is an umbrella term for the methods by which a computer handles human language text. This includes transforming the text into a numerical form that the computer manipulates natively, as well as the measurements that reserchers often perform. In the parlance, <i>natural language</i> refers to a language spoken by humans, as opposed to a <i>formal language</i>, such as Python, which comprises a set of logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to jump right in to text analysis and natural language processing. Rather than starting with the nitty gritty of programming in Python, this lesson will demonstrate some neat things you can do with a minimal amount of coding. Today, we aim to build intuition about how computers read human text and learn some of the basic operations we'll perform with them.\n",

    "# 0. Key Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "* *programming* (or *coding*)\n",
    "    * A program is a sequence of instructions given to the computer, in order to perform a specific task. Those instructions are written in a specific *programming language*, in our case, Python. Writing these instructions can be an art as much as a science.\n",
    "* *Python*\n",
    "    * A general-use programming language that is popular for NLP and statistics.\n",
    "* *script*\n",
    "    * A block of executable code.\n",
    "* *Jupyter Notebook*\n",
    "    * Jupyter is a popular interface in which Python scripts can be written and executed. Stand-alone scripts are saved in Notebooks. The script can be sub-divided into units called <i>cells</i> and executed individually. Cells can also contain discursive text and html formatting (such as in this cell!)\n",
    "* *package* (or *module*)\n",
    "    * Python offers a basic set of functions that can be used off-the-shelf. However, we often wish to go beyond the basics. To that end, <i>packages</i> are collections of python files that contain pre-made functions. These functions are made available to our program when we <i>import</i> the package that contains them.\n",
    "* *Anaconda*\n",
    "    * Anaconda is a <i>platform</i> for programming in Python. A platform constitutes a closed environment on your computer that has been standardized for functionality. For example, Anaconda contains common packages and programming interfaces for Python, and its developers ensure compatibility among the moving parts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### When Programming\n",
    "* *variable*\n",
    "    * A variable is a generic container that stores a value, such as a number or series of letters. This is not like a variable from high-school algebra, which had a single \"correct\" value that must be solved. Rather, the user <i>assigns</i> values to the variable in order to perform operations on it later.\n",
    "* *string*\n",
    "    * A type of object consisting of a single sequence of alpha-numeric characters. In Python, a string is indicated by quotation marks around the sequence\"\n",
    "* *list*\n",
    "    * A type of object that consists of a sequence of elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Natural Language Processing\n",
    "* *pre-processing*\n",
    "    * Transforming a human lanugage text into computer-manipulable format. A typical pre-processing workflow includes <i>stop-word</i> removal, setting text in lower case, and <i>term frequency</i> counting.\n",
    "* *token*\n",
    "    * An individual word unit within a sentence.\n",
    "* *stop words*\n",
    "    * The function words in a natural langauge, such as <i>the</i>, <i>of</i>, <i>it</i>, etc. These are typically the most common words.\n",
    "* *term frequency*\n",
    "    * The number of times a term appears in a given text. This is either reported as a raw tally or it is <i>normalized</i> by dividing by the total number of words in a text.    \n",
    "* *POS tagging*\n",
    "    * One common task in NLP is the determination of a word's part-of-speech (POS). The label that describes a word's POS is called its <i>tag</i>. Specialized functions that make these determinations are called <i>POS Taggers</i>.\n",
    "* *concordance*\n",
    "    * Index of instances of a given word (or other linguistic feature) in a text. Typically, each instance is presented within a contextual window for human readability.\n",
    "* *NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit)*\n",
    "    * A common Python package that contains many NLP-related functions\n",
